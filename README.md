# Generative AI Landscape: From Popular Services to DIY Solutions on Azure (Azure Day Torino 2023)

In this repository you can find the slides for **Generative AI Landscape: From Popular Services to DIY Solutions on Azure** session, presented (in Italian) at [Azure Day Torino 2023](https://www.azureday.it/) on October 14th, 2023.

Abstract:

We will explore the state-of-the-art of generative AI for various use cases. After providing an overview of the most renowned services such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and RunwayML, we will delve into potential approaches for implementing similar services by leveraging open-source tools, frameworks, and models while harnessing the computational power offered by Azure.
